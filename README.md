Powder Planner
 This application allows the users to look up locations from around the world and
 get the weather and snowfall. The user can save locations to keep an eye out for when
 the best snowfall is and plan accordingly.

 Unit 2 was very difficult and at times I didn't know if I was going to make it!
 My project is not complete, but after today I can say I have a better grasp
 on the MVC and the layout. There are a ton of moving parts and I focused on
 better understanding the structure and flow of how everything worked together.
 I started the project out with a different idea and had to change due to API difficulties,
 so my wireframe or trello are not up to date. I will be coming back to visit how to implement an API as well as CRUD.
